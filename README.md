# **Vibration Analysis on Rotating Shaft with LightningChart Python**

## **What is Vibration Analysis?**

Vibration analysis refers to the process of monitoring the levels and patterns of vibration signals generated by a machine or its components. It serves as an essential diagnostic tool to detect faults, identify their causes, and predict failures in rotating machinery. Vibration is defined as a cyclic or oscillating motion from the rest position of a component or system. 

### **What is Machine Vibration?**
Machine vibration is an inherent phenomenon caused by unbalanced rotating components, misalignment, bearing wear, or resonance. It can be quantified using vibration sensors attached to critical areas of machinery. These sensors measure oscillations in components, enabling engineers to identify and fix potential issues before catastrophic failure occurs.

### **How Are Sensors Used to Collect Data?**
Vibration sensors capture real-time vibration signals as the machinery operates. In this project, PCB Synotech vibration sensors are placed strategically on a rotating shaft, measuring oscillations caused by varying levels of unbalance. A high sampling rate of 4096 Hz ensures detailed data acquisition, enabling fine-grained analysis.

### **1.Dashboard: Vibration Intensity and Unbalance Comparison**

**Description:**  
This dashboard integrates three complementary charts—**Bar Chart**, **Spider Chart**, and **Line Chart**—to comprehensively visualize the relationships between unbalance strength, vibration intensity, and RPM. It enables intuitive comparisons across datasets and provides actionable insights into vibration behavior under various operating conditions.

---

#### **1. Average Vibration Intensity by Unbalance Strength**  
The bar chart in the first column of the dashboard displays the average vibration intensity for each dataset, categorized by unbalance strength. Each bar represents a unique unbalance configuration defined by radius and mass. This visualization quantifies the overall impact of unbalance strength on vibration levels.  

#### **2. Comparative Analysis of Unbalance Strengths**  
The spider chart in the second column visualizes the distribution of vibration components (`Vibration_1`, `Vibration_2`, `Vibration_3`) for various unbalance strengths. Data points are normalized to enable clear comparison across datasets. Each axis corresponds to a vibration metric, highlighting specific vibration patterns under different configurations.

#### **3. Impact of Unbalance on Vibration (Sensor 1)**  
The line chart in the second row captures how vibration intensity, measured by Sensor 1, changes with RPM for each unbalance strength. Each line represents a dataset, allowing dynamic tracking of vibration behavior as rotational speed increases.  

---

**Results:**  
- **Bar Chart:** The vibration intensity decreases with increasing unbalance strength, particularly for configurations with higher radius and mass (e.g., 4D dataset). The 0D dataset (no unbalance) shows the lowest vibration intensity, confirming the importance of balance.  
- **Spider Chart:** Configurations with higher unbalance strengths (e.g., 4D) exhibit pronounced variation in specific vibration components, while the 0D dataset remains consistently low across all metrics.  
- **Line Chart:** Vibration intensity decreases significantly with increasing RPM, especially for higher unbalance strengths. The 0D dataset shows minimal variation, demonstrating its stability.  

---

**Use Cases:**  
- **Diagnostic Insights:** Understand how unbalance affects overall vibration levels across metrics and RPM.  
- **Design Optimization:** Optimize machine configurations by reducing unbalance-induced vibrations.  
- **Dynamic Monitoring:** Track vibration behavior across RPM ranges to identify critical thresholds.
